üìê Prompt: Write an ETL pipeline or API that combines two or more sources of data and displays simple insights on a dashboard


Details:

    Data can be in whatever form you like - csv, json, pdfs, integrations
    We would prefer to see Salesforce data as one of the sources. You can create mock data using Mockaroo. Other data sources could include Stripe, pdf invoices, Netsuite, Looker
    Your ETL pipeline or API need to do more than "fetch and show". What you build is up to you ‚Äî we would like to see you demonstrate your own creativity and thought process.
    Spend the amount of time that is reasonable to you. Choose wisely on what to implement and write down what you would do with more time available. Deploying it to a server is nice, but not required.
    Provide a README of:
        What did you build?
        How would one run the service?
        A reasonable decision log of what you think is important. We like to see thoughtful work.
        Approximately how long did it take to build this solution
    Please provide a reasonable amount of tests to cover the work done.
